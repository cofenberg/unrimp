	This file is released in the hopes that it will be useful. Use in whatever way you like, but no guarantees that it
	actually works or fits any particular purpose. It has been unit-tested and benchmarked though, and seems to do
	what it was designed to do, and seems pretty quick at it too.

Notes: 
	There are many applications where it is desired to generate unique IDs at runtime for various resources, such that they can be
	distinguished, sorted or otherwise processed in an efficient manner. It can in some cases replace hashes, handles and pointers.
	In cases where resource pointers are used as IDs, it offers a unique ID that requires far fewer bits, especially for 64bit apps.
	The design goal of this implementation was to return the most compact IDs as possible, limiting to a specific range if necessary.

	The properties of this system are as follows:
		- Creating a new ID returns the smallest possible unused ID.
		- Creating a new range of IDs returns the smallest possible continuous range of the specified size.
		- Created IDs remain valid until destroyed.
		- Destroying an ID returns it to the pool and may be returned by subsequent allocations.
		- The system is NOT thread-safe.

	Performance properties:
		- Creating an ID is O(1) and generally super-cheap.
		- Destroying an ID is also cheap, but O(log(n)), where n is the current number of distinct available ranges.
		- The system merges available ranges when IDs are destroyed, keeping said n generally very small in practice.
		- After warmup, no further memory allocations should be necessary, or be very rare.
		- The system uses very little memory.
		- It is possible to construct a pathological case where fragmentation would cause n to become large. This can be done by
		  first allocating a very large range of IDs, then deleting every other ID, causing a new range to be allocated for every
		  free ID, or as many ranges as there are free IDs. I believe nothing close to this situation happens in practical applications.
		  In tests, millions of random scattered creations and deletions only resulted in a relatively short list in the worst case.
		  This is because freed IDs are quickly reused and ranges eagerly merged.

	Where would this system be useful? It was originally thought up as a replacement for resource pointers as part of sort-ids
	in rendering. Using for instance a 64-bit sort-id packing various flags and states, putting a pointer in there takes an
	awful lot of bits, especially considering the actual possible resources range in the thousands at most. This got far worse
	of course with the switch to 64bit as pointers are now twice as large and essentially eats all bits except bottom few for
	alignment.
	Another application would be for managing a shared pool of resources. IDs could be handed out as handles and used to access
	the actual resource from an array. By always returning the lowest possible ID or range of IDs we get very good cache behavior
	since all active resources will grouped together in the bottom part of the array. Using IDs instead of pointers for handles
	also allows easy resizing of the allocated memory since IDs can remain the same even if the underlying storage changed.
