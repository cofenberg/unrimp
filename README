== Unrimp Description ==
Unified renderer implementation ("Un r imp"). Extensive examples from basic to advanced are provided as well.


== Features ==
- General library design
	- Compact user-header for the renderer API
		- A single all in one header for ease-of-use and best possible compile times
		- No need to links against the renderer library itself, load renderer interface implementations dynamically during runtime
	- Lightweight renderer implementations
		- Implementations try to stick as best as possible close-to-the-metal and as a result are just a few KiB instead of MiB in memory size
		- Implementations load the entry points of Direct3D, OpenGL and so on during runtime, meaning it's possible to react on system failures by e.g. dynamically switching to another renderer implementation
	- Support for static and dynamic build
- Renderer implementations for
	- Direct3D 9
	- Direct3D 10
	- Direct3D 11
	- OpenGL
	- OpenGL ES 2
- Cross-platform
	- Windows
	- Linux
- Shaders
	- Vertex shader (VS)
	- Tessellation control shader (TCS, "hull shader" in Direct3D terminology)
	- Tessellation evaluation shader (TES, "domain shader" in Direct3D terminology)
	- Geometry shader (GS)
	- Fragment shader (FS, "pixel shader" in Direct3D terminology)
- Vertex array object (VAO, input-assembler (IA) stage) with support for multiple vertex streams
	- Vertex buffer object (VBO, input-assembler (IA) stage)
	- Index buffer object (IBO, input-assembler (IA) stage)
- Render targets
	- Swap chains, render into one or multiple operation system windows
	- Framebuffer object (FBO) used for render to texture, support for multiple render targets (MRT)
- Buffers
	- Uniform buffer object (UBO, "constant buffer" in Direct3D terminology)
	- Texture buffer object (TBO)
- Textures
	- 2D texture
	- 2D texture array
- State objects with mapping to API specific settings during creation, not runtime
	- Rasterizer state object (rasterizer stage (RS))
	- Depth stencil state object (output-merger (OM) stage)
	- Blend state object (output-merger (OM) stage)
	- Sampler state object (SO)
- Collections to potentially reduce the number of state changes
	- Texture collection
	- Sampler state collection
- Instancing support
	- Instanced arrays (shader model 3 feature, vertex array element advancing per-instance instead of per-vertex)
	- Draw instanced (shader model 4 feature, build in shader variable holding the current instance ID)
- Debug methods
	- When using Direct3D <11.1, those methods map to the Direct3D 9 PIX functions (D3DPERF_* functions, also works directly within VisualStudio 2012 out-of-the-box)
	- Used inside the renderer implementations for better renderer debugging
- Renderer implementation specific optimizations
	- OpenGL: Usage of direct state access (DSA), if available


== Hints ==
The unified renderer interface can't unify some graphics API behaviour differences. Here's a list of hints you might want to know:
- Texel coordinate system origin
	- OpenGL: Left/bottom
	- Direct3D: Left/top
		- See "Coordinate Systems (Direct3D 10)" at MSDN http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc308049%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
- Pixel coordinate system 
	- Direct3D: See "Coordinate Systems (Direct3D 10)" at MSDN http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc308049%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
- Clip space coordinate system
	- OpenGL: [-1, -1, -1] ... [1, 1, 1]
	- Direct3D: [-1, -1, 0] ... [1, 1, 1]
